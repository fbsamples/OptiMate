# Test & Learn

## Measure impact on media and brand outcomes
Let's provide an example with dummy data when using Module 6: Key Performance indicators.

### 1. Campaign set-up

### 2. Additional scenarios with OptiMate

### 3. Analyzing optimized results
![Predictions](\img\OptiMate_TestLearn_03.png)

Note that the Business as usual scenario allows to get desired KPIs for weekly frequency and CPM but not for reach (2 millions). But OptiMate allows to identify a different set-up that helps to get all desired KPIs by reducing the campaign duration by 1 week with the same budget.

### 4. Brand Lift Multi-cell design

### 5. Caveats

1. All simulations are directly related to the audience, dates, budget and frequency control caps defined at the beginning. Hence, predictions cannot be extrapolated to other estimations that consider different parameters.

2. The decision on what parameters combination to be used, will depend on the desired KPIs and having in mind all the trade-offs inherent to each combination.

3. It is recommended that estimations can be validated using Brand Lift Multi-cell to have in addition business brand outcomes, such as ad recall, message association, purchase intent, etc.

4. All predictions are estimations based on the indicated dates and the results may vary according to other different dates or the reserve itself.

5. No estimation shown is warranty for expected results in future Reach & Frequency reserves.
