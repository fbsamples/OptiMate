# FAQs
**Q1**: Is there a user interface for OptiMate?

**A1**: No. Our goal is that each user develops its own user interface. This assures that it will be compatible with each user environment or internal planning tools/systems

**Q2**: Who is OptiMate relevant to?

**A2**. To any active Meta Ads users that are interested in improving results for branding campaigns (using Reach & Frequency objectives). Also for users that are interested in exploring brand business outcomes in addition to media outcomes.

**Q3**: What are the main requirements to integrate OptiMate?

**A3**: Having an active **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)** account, being able to admin or manage a Meta Ads Account (Through **[Meta Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com/settings)** or **[Meta Ads Manager](https://adsmanager.facebook.com/adsmanager)**) and create a Meta app in **[Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/)**.

**Q4**: Is it possible to customize placements such as Facebook feed, Instagram stories, etc.?

**A4**: By default all modules consider automatic placements (a best practice), except for Module 9 that uses only Facebook InStream video placement by design. In case you need to customize placements you can take a look at the Meta for Developers **[Placement Targeting](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/audiences/reference/placement-targeting)** documentation, sky is the limit!

**Q5**: Are predictions static or fixed?

**A5**: No. Each prediction will vary depending on selected Ad Account, Facebook Page and Instagram Account. Furthermore, temporality plays a big role. The same input parameters might bring different results depending on lower or higher seasonalities (holidays or end of the year for example). OptiMate uses the same reserve Reach & Frequency system/buying type, that means that time/dates are also a variable to consider.

**Q6**: Can I use OptiMate with Auction objectives?

**A6**: No, as OptiMate relies on Reach & Frequency reserve system, it is limited to the same objectives that R&F uses: Reach, Awareness, Traffic, Video Views and Engagement.

**Q7**: How accurate are OptiMate predictions versus real results?

**A7**: It's very accurate as predictions are based on the **[Reach & Frequency](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reachandfrequency/?translation)** reserve system. As soon as you reserve the campaign you simulate, more accuracy you will have when comparing predictions versus post-campaign observed results.

**Q8**: What is the difference between **Meta Ads Manager Reach & Frequency predictions** or **Meta Campaign Planner predictions** versus OptiMate?

**A8**: Underlying data is the same (R&F predictions) among these systems, but OptiMate adds a layer to drive time efficiencies with the automation of the Marketing API by providing hundreds of simulations in a very short time compared to commonly used manual processes. A very simple analogy is: OptiMate is not meant to re-invent the wheel, but to produce it at scale.
